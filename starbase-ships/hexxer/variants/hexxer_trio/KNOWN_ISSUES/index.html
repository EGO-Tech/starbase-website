<ul>
<li><strong>For version 1.0.0</strong>: Ship can get stuck in load sequence if <code>Load</code> is deactivated before completing. To reset, activate all lock beams and activate <code>Load</code> for all compartments. Then all lock beams can be deactivated.</li>
<li>When asteroids are loaded more on one side, the ship can become unbalanced and appraoch will not work as well. Manual appraoch would probably be better.</li>
<li>Currently there are no navigation features but will possibly add ISAN and Compass in the future if this ship becomes useful to Endos</li>
</ul>
