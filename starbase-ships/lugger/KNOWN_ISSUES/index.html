<ul>
<li>There is limited coverage of range finders for the crash avoidance system. <strong>Use at your own risk!</strong></li>
<li>Autopilot doesn't seem to point ship directly to destination (a bit off), use in conjunction with NavGrid.</li>
<li>The ship is pretty much at its voxel limit so any additions or changes may be difficult without sacrificing crates.</li>
</ul>
