<ul>
<li>When asteroids are loaded more on one side, the ship can become unbalanced and thrust efficiency drops</li>
<li>Currently there are no navigation features but will possibly add ISAN and Compass in the future if this ship becomes useful to Endos</li>
<li>Sometimes after printing the ship, the tractor beams' pitch are not right at the starting position, fix by manually setting the turret pitch (<code>tbh1</code> &amp; <code>tbh2</code>) to <code>-15</code>. Or it will fix itself after you load an asteroid on each side (manually point beam at the asteroids).</li>
</ul>
