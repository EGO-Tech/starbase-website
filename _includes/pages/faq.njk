  <h2 id="faq010">Can I sell ships based on EGOTech blueprints?</h2>

  <p>No.</p>

  <h2 id="faq020">Can I share EGOTech blueprints?</h2>

  <p>For the free blueprints, you can share it with as many people as you want, just don't pass them off as your own.</p>

  <p>
    For blueprints that are purchased, the purchase only allows for the unlimited use for one person.
    If you wish to have a company or group license, please let me know and we can work something out.
  </p>

  <h2 id="faq030">Do I get access to future updates for blueprint purchases?</h2>

  <p>Yes. A blueprint purchase provides access to all future updates to the ship's blueprints.</p>

  <h2 id="faq040">Where can I see all the ship's YOLOL code?</h2>

  <p>
    Every ship will have a link to its GitHub page in the <code>Links</code> section of its ship page.
    The YOLOL code are in the <code>yolol</code> folder of the ship GitHub page.
  </p>
